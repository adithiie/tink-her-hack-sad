### Project Description
We‚Äôve created a website to help millennials connect with Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and Gen Beta by learning their slang and commonly used words. The platform features three interactive levels and daily challenges where users can discover five new words every day.

### The Problem statement
The ridiculous problem we‚Äôre solving is bridging the generational communication gap. Millennials often struggle to understand the fast-evolving slang of Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and Gen Beta. Our website makes this process fun and engaging, helping them decode, learn, and confidently use modern lingo to stay relevant and connect better with younger generations.

### The Solution
We‚Äôre solving it by creating an interactive website with three engaging levels: Match the Vibes, Oopsie Check, and Slang-Off, each designed to teach and test understanding of modern slang in a fun way. Additionally, we offer a Daily Challenges section, where users learn 5 fresh slang words every day, ensuring they stay updated and can seamlessly communicate with Gen Z, Gen Alpha, and beyond.
